# Burgundians
The Burgundians draw from the late medieval Duchy of Burgundy, a wealthy and politically sharp realm perched between France and the Holy Roman Empire. Driven by ambitious dukes and enriched by thriving Flemish cities, Burgundy became famous for courtly splendor, hard bargaining, and battlefield power—often rivaling kings while navigating the perilous game of European politics.
