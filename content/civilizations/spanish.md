# Spanish
Forged on the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish rise from a long age of frontier warfare and shifting kingdoms, culminating in the Reconquista and the consolidation of power under united crowns. With a reputation for hard-edged soldiery and fervent religion, Spain later projected its influence far beyond Europe through exploration, conquest, and an empire that reshaped the early modern world.
