# Britons

The Britons were the native Celtic peoples of Britain, shaped by tribal kingdoms, Roman contact, and the turbulent centuries after Rome’s withdrawal. In a landscape of hillforts, warrior bands, and shifting alliances, Brittonic tribes fought to endure amid migration and invasion, leaving a legacy that echoes through early medieval lore and the deep cultural roots of the isles.
