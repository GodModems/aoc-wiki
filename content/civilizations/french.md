# French
From Frankish tribes to a medieval kingdom, France grew into a major European power defined by chivalric culture, expanding royal authority, and centuries of conflict with rivals near and far. Whether through the clashes of the Hundred Years’ War or the rise of centralized monarchy, the French story is one of resilience, ambition, and enduring cultural influence.
