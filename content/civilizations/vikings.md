# Vikings
The Vikings were seafaring Norse peoples from Scandinavia who reshaped early medieval Europe through raiding, trading, settlement, and exploration. Renowned for longships and coastal mobility, they established footholds from the British Isles to Normandy and pushed routes east through river networks and south into the Mediterranean world, blending ruthless opportunism with vibrant law codes, craftsmanship, and saga-bound culture.

## Rules
Your [pawns](#/pieces/pawn) gain the ability to attack directly in front of them.
If an enemy [pawn](#/pieces/pawn) takes a Viking [major piece](#/pieces/index#major), the enemy [pawn](#/pieces/pawn) also dies.
