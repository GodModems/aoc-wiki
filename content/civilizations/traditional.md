# Traditional
Traditional chess emerged as a strategic board game of courts and scholars, refined over centuries into a tightly balanced duel of calculation, memory, and long-term planning. With fixed armies and symmetrical starts, it distills warfare into pure position and tempo, where a single inaccuracy can snowball and a well-timed sacrifice can decide the entire story of the game.
