# Chinese
China’s civilization spans powerful dynasties built on bureaucracy, scholarship, and large-scale statecraft, sustaining one of the world’s longest continuous cultural traditions. Innovations in engineering, agriculture, and military technology—alongside trade networks like the Silk Road—helped China project influence across Asia while repeatedly reinventing itself through unity, fragmentation, and reunification.

## Rules
Start with 2 extra [pawns](#/pieces/pawn) on **d3** and **e3** (for Black: **d6** and **e6**).
- These extra [pawns](#/pieces/pawn) do **not** get the normal 2-square first move.
Your [King](#/pieces/king) is replaced with an [Emperor](#/pieces/emperor).
If the [Emperor](#/pieces/emperor) dies and you have **2 or more** [pawns](#/pieces/pawn), convert a [pawn](#/pieces/pawn) into a new [Emperor](#/pieces/chinese).
- This does not use your turn.
You lose when you have no [Emperor](#/pieces/emperor).
