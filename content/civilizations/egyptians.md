# Egyptians

Along the Nile, Egyptian civilization flourished around a river-fed lifeline that enabled monumental building, complex administration, and a distinctive religious worldview centered on divine kingship. From dynastic pharaohs and temple cities to long cycles of foreign challenge and renewal, Egypt’s legacy is marked by engineering brilliance, enduring symbolism, and a civilization that captivated the ancient world.
