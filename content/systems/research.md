# Research

**Research** is a match-level modifier chosen at the start of the game. Players vote, and each vote increases the chance that the selected Research occurs. By default, there are **2 votes for “Dark Age”** (no special changes).  

> Assumption (can be edited): **Exactly one** Research is selected per match unless a gamemode states otherwise.

## How voting works
1. At the start of the game, each player casts votes for the Research they want.
2. More votes = higher chance that Research is selected.
3. “Dark Age” starts with bonus votes by default.
