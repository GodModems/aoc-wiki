The **Ninja** is a Pawn-variant used by some civilizations. It uses **normal pawn movement/capturing**, but has extra mobility and a special promotion turn. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Summary
- **Moves/Captures:** normal pawn rules. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **Jumping:** can jump over **enemy pawns**. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- **Promotion:** on reaching the far rank, promote normally, then **immediately move again** (2 moves in 1 turn). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Movement & Capturing
Ninja movement/capture is the same as a Pawn in your ruleset. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Jumping enemy pawns
When moving as a Ninja, it may jump over enemy pawns (exact jump conditions should match your core rules). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Promotion and extra move
Upon reaching the far rank:
1. Promote as a normal pawn would, then
2. Immediately take another move (still during the same turn). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
