# Pharaoh

The **Pharaoh** is a royal replacement whose movement depends on your **bishop count** and cannot jump. :contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}

## Summary
- **Jumping:** cannot jump over pieces. :contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}
- **Movement scaling:** depends on your bishop count. :contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}

## Movement (based on bishop count)
- **4 bishops:** +2 in all directions. :contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}
- **2–3 bishops:** +2 diagonal only. :contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}
- **0–1 bishop:** normal King movement. :contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}

Interpretation for play (recommended wording):
- When you have a “+2” condition active, the Pharaoh may move **up to 2 squares** in the allowed directions, but is blocked by intervening pieces (no jumping). :contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}

## Capturing
Captures by moving onto the target square using the same movement rules (and still cannot jump). :contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}

## Used by
- **Egyptians:** King is replaced with a Pharaoh. :contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}
