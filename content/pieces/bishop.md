# Bishop

The **Bishop** is a diagonal line piece. Unless modified by civilization/research, it follows standard bishop movement.

## Summary
- **Moves:** any number of squares diagonally.
- **Captures:** by landing on the target square.
- **Jumping:** cannot jump over pieces.


## Common modifiers (research)
- **[Manifest Destiny](#/research/manifest-destiny)**: bishops may move one square directly forward.

- **Missionaries:** bishops can teleport to any square its partner can move to, but can only capture on squares it could already move to. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
- **Inquisitors:** on capturing a high-value piece (not a pawn or a ninja), the bishop must immediately move again. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}
