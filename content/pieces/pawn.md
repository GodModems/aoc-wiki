# Pawn

The **Pawn** is the baseline frontline unit. Unless a civilization/research modifies it, the Pawn follows **normal pawn movement and capturing**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Summary
- **Moves:** forward.
- **Captures:** diagonally forward.
- **Promotion:** on reaching the far rank (ruleset-dependent; see “Promotion” below).

## Movement
A Pawn advances **forward** (toward the opponent’s side). Exact options (1-step, optional 2-step, etc.) follow your core ruleset.

## Capturing
A Pawn captures **diagonally forward** (standard pawn capture pattern).

## Promotion
Promotion triggers when a Pawn reaches the far rank (commonly the 8th rank for White / 1st for Black). In some rules, promotion options may be restricted by Research (example: “Morganatic Marriage”). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Common modifiers (by civ/research)
- **Vikings:** pawns can attack directly in front; enemy pawn may die after capturing Viking non-pawn. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Britons:** pawns do not move when attacking; can also attack two squares forward if they did not move last turn. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Japanese:** pawns are replaced by Ninjas. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Fletching (Research):** pawns no longer move while capturing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
